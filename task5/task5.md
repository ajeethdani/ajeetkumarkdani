**Final Task to Carry out the GLS - GateLevelSimulation**

**THEORY ABOUT GLS:**


Gate-level simulation in VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) involves simulating the behavior of a digital circuit at the level of individual logic gates. At this level, the design is represented by the connections between logic gates, flip-flops, and other basic building blocks. Gate-level simulation allows for detailed analysis of circuit timing, power consumption, and functionality. It verifies the correctness of the design by simulating the propagation of signals through the gates, ensuring that the circuit operates as intended. Gate-level simulation is crucial for detecting and debugging errors in the design before fabrication, optimizing performance, and ensuring compatibility with target hardware platforms.

**Synthesis directory check is mandatory.**

it should contain
  -  Gatelevel netlist
  -  standard cell library
  -  Yosys Synthesis Script
